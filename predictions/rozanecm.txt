2019.10.28 - 09:12:00: repeat first approach. This time, train with all the data. On previous runs, I trianed only with X_test, which is a part of the whole given train set.
2019.10.28 - 12:03:46: Second approach. Same as previous, but adding categorical features with one hot encoding + svd dim. red., to 11 dimensions in the small cases, and to 100 in the larger one. Algorithm is same as previously.
